# CTC26
CTC26: A New Reality, which we held at [ONE Codebase in Aberdeen](https://www.thisiscodebase.com/aberdeen1) held 21 May- 22 May 2022. We had 13 participants on the Saturday. There were ?? people on Sunday. You can find more at [https://codethecity.org/what-we-do/hack-weekends/ctc26/](https://codethecity.org/what-we-do/hack-weekends/ctc26/) We had three teams of peole exploring different ideas. 

We planned on enabling a hybrid event, but there were no online tickets, so it all happened in person. We pulled out the sticky notes and sharpies from storge, and ordered food for attendees. It was interesting to do this with people and food and such.

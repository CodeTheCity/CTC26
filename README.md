# CTC26
CTC26: A New Reality, which we held at [ONE Codebase in Aberdeen](https://www.thisiscodebase.com/aberdeen1) held 21 May- 22 May 2022. We had 13 participants on the Saturday. There were ?? people on Sunday. You can find more at [https://codethecity.org/what-we-do/hack-weekends/ctc26/](https://codethecity.org/what-we-do/hack-weekends/ctc26/) We had three teams of peole exploring different ideas. 

We planned on enabling a hybrid event, but there were no online tickets, so it all happened in person. We pulled out the sticky notes and sharpies from storge, and ordered food for attendees. It was interesting to do this with people and food and such.

## The Projects at A New Reality Were

### The Open Data Catalogue of Scottish Local Authorities
[The OD Bods](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/the_od_bods) which started at CTC23 continues as an opportunity for the team to work together. You can see their progress at https://github.com/OpenDataScotland/the_od_bods/ which feeds the website at https://opendata.scot The goal this weekend was to automate the manual scripts.

### Oan Yer Bike

### The Fediverse
Explore options for creating communities in Mastadon and elsewhere.

This project looked at the possiblity of better use of Fediverse platforms for CTC. We focused on Mastodon in particular. We identfied a gap in Mastodon for a "tech and data for civic good" / UK-level (?)community. It is suggested that we explore this further - perhaps at SODU session in Nov 2022 - to see what appetite exists for other organisations and individuals to join such a community. We also identified the opportunity for CTC to use Fediverse alternatives for Instagram and Youtube, and to create and maintain bots to post content (perhaps replicating content from existing platforms). We closed this project down before lunch Saturday, and members joined other teams.
